    <h1>Numerical solutions to Ordinary differential equations</h1>
    <h2>Basics</h2>
    <p>
        Ordinary differential equations, are equations that involve ordinary derivatives of a function. Usually the goal is
        to determine the function that solves this equation. ODEs are characterized by the highest order of their
        derivative, which is also the order of the differential equation.

        The example given above is the first order differential equation we are goint to solve.
    <h2>Numerical methods</h2>
    
    Since many differential equations are hard to solve mathematically, numerical methods have been developed to compute
    aproximate solutions.
    <h3>Euler integration</h3>
    The simplest method of numerical integration. At each timestep we calculate the current derivative, multiply it by the
    timestep to get the change in y direction and add it to the previous y value to get the next state.
    <!-- y_{n+1} = y_n + h \cdot f(t,y_n) -->

    A possible JS implementation for the euler method is
    <code contenteditable>
    <pre>for (let i = 0; i < resolution; i++) {
      ys[i + 1] =  ys[i] + f(ts[i], ys[i]) * h
    }
    return {
     ts: ts, //time series
     ys: ys //resulting y points
    }</pre>
    </code>
    The main drawback of the Euler method is, that the error scales with O(h^2) and therefore may not be stable for longer
    running simulations.
