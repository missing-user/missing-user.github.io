Here we go with another maths heavy project. I tried my best to explain how the numerical methods work and add code examples where sensible. There are also a few demos solving popular differential equations like the [Lotka Volterra equations](https://jurasic.dev/ode/lotkavolterra) or the [Lorenz attractor](https://jurasic.dev/ode/lorenz).
