A bunch of tiny Websites where I explore some more radical design concepts and experimental methods. I'm especially proud of this [modern background animation](https://jurasic.dev/design_experiments/background_animation) and how the prototype for a friends [photography portfolio](https://jurasic.dev/design_experiments/photography "Photography portfolio prototype") turned out.
