Inspired by the lecture we had, I made a small visualizer that shows how point charges interact with each other, move and most importantly shape the electric field. Click on the green canvas to add charges, modify the parameters, build parcours for them, go nuts! This one is using a simple euler integrator and no special optimizations, but it's fun!
