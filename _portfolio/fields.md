Inspired by the lecture we had, I made a small visualizer that shows how point charges interact with each other, move and most importantly shape the electric field. Click on the green canvas to add charges, modify the parameters, build parcours for them, go nuts! It's not exactly physically accurate, because I'm using discrete time steps, but it gets the job done and looks pretty cool.
