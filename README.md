# Witty title
Right now this is just a placeholder, I will update it over time and make proper custom themes etc.



## Projects
### Corona Live Counter 
A visualization of how often people get infected by corona/recover/die. The data is being fetched from [this API](https://corona.lmao.ninja/) and processed to calculate the average intervals.
Individual country visualizations are also available. [here](https://missing-user.github.io/coronaTimer/) is the website.

### Corona Map
A variation of the live counter project that lights up the individual countries in regular intervals, according to the average time between infections in that country. It's not pretty, but it's functional [try it out!](https://missing-user.github.io/coronaVizMap/)

### Virus simulation
Simple virus simulation to show the effects of social distancing, improved hygiene and different attributes of the virus. Just play around with the parameters [here](https://missing-user.github.io/pandemicSimulator/)

### Physics simulation
My attempt at implementing a spatial hashing algorithm for 2D physics. Full support for overlap detection of circles, points and axis aligned rectangles. Currently simple repulsion and attraction forces are supported for circles, WIP for more. [try it here](https://missing-user.github.io/physicsSim/) ![physics sim preview](/images/physicssim.webp)

### Tronald Dump API 
Just messing around with the [tronald dump API](https://www.tronalddump.io/), if you want to see what I came up with [check it out](https://missing-user.github.io/API_experiments/)

### Electric fields
visualize electric fields of point charges. [here](https://missing-user.github.io/elektrischeFelder/)
