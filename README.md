## Welcome to my GitHub Page

Right now this is just a placeholder, I will update it over time and make proper custom themes etc.

### Projects

Here's a list of my projects you can try out immediately in your browser! 

- **Corona Live Counter** A visualization of how often people get infected by corona/recover/die. 
The data is being fetched from [this API](https://corona.lmao.ninja/) and processed to calculate the average intervals.
Individual country visualizations are also available. [here](/coronaViz) is the website
- **Corona Map** a variation of the live counter project that lights up the individual countries in regular intervals, according to the average time between infections in that country. 
It's not pretty, but it's functional [try it out](/coronaVizMap)
