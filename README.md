# Personal website

My little web dev playground... Have you been wondering what kinds of projects I've been building lately?
Fear no more! Just check out [the website](https://missing-user.github.io) and you'll be up to date!

Everything is written in plain JS, CSS & HTML, and should have no dependencies except for the font.

I'm using Jekyll as the static site generator and forestry.io as my CMS.

## Usage

To setup the local environment run `bundle` and then `bundle exec jekyll serve`.
