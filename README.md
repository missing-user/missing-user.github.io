# Personal website
My little web dev playground... Have you been wondering what kinds of projects I've been building lately?
Fear no more! Just check out [the website](https://missing-user.github.io) and you'll be up to date!


Everything is written in plain JS, CSS & HTML, should have no dependencies except for the font.

I'll be migrating the Website to Jekyll soon, so expect a bunch of stuff to break during that time.
