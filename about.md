## About Me <span class="waveHand">👋🏻</span>

Hi, I'm Philipp Jurašić, a physics student and web designer/developer from Germany. I love building applications that connect with people, especially anything visual and interactive. My preferred tech stack are static site generators like Jekyll with a minimal CMS. 

If you want to build you a fast and modern site or web app, hit me up at [jurasic-park@gmx.de](mailto:jurasic-park@gmx.de "E-Mail")!

You can find some of my recent work on the [homepage](https://jurasic-park.de/).

You can find me on [GitHub](https://github.com/missing-user), [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/philippjurasic/) or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/philipp-jurasic).
