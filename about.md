## About Me

Hi, I'm Philipp Jurašić, a physics student from Germany. I love building electronics, simulations and all kinds of software projects - especially anything visual and interactive. You can find my recent work on my [homepage](https://jurasic-park.de/)

## Social

* I'm most active on [GitHub](https://github.com/missing-user), where you can find all my coding projects
* Add me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/philipp-jurasic) if you're into that
* Or on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/philippjurasic/) if you want to see my face

## Previous Work

* I'm currently designing and managing the website for a local [dance school](https://musicalschulehaar.de/impressum "Dansation")
* My term paper about measuring CO₂ levels in classrooms got awarded by the [Hans Riegel Foundation](https://www.hans-riegel-fachpreise.com/news/herausragende-mint-schuelerarbeiten-erhalten-dr-hans-riegel-fachpreise)
* A few years ago a friend and I built a low cost SLA 3D printer using an old DLP projector for the regional science contest "Jugend Forscht", and were able to secure [first place in Munich](https://www.merkur.de/lokales/muenchen-lk/jugend-forscht-aus-spiel-wird-experiment-7412119.html)
