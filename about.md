## Hi, I'm Philipp! <span class="waveHand">üëãüèª</span>

Studying Computational Science and Engineering at TUM, I specialize in physics simulations and high performance computing. Right now I'm working on my master's thesis in Fusion Research with [IPP](https://www.ipp.mpg.de/en) and [Proxima Fusion](https://www.proximafusion.com/).

## Leave me a message!

If you'd like to collaborate on a project or leave some feedback, just drop me a message at [philipp@jurasic.dev](mailto:philipp@jurasic.dev "Contact email")! I'd love to hear from you. You can also find me on [GitHub](https://github.com/missing-user) or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/philipp-jurasic)!
