Hi, I'm **Philipp Jurašić** (aka [missing-user](https://github.com/missing-user)) and I specialize in physics simulations, numerics and high performance computing. Right now I'm finishing my master's thesis in stellarator optimization at [IPP](https://www.ipp.mpg.de/en) and working at [Proxima Fusion](https://www.proximafusion.com/).

I love building [interactive simulations](https://jurasic.dev/2023/barnes-hut-simulation/), doing pretty much anything in the mountains and sometimes making [art with computers](https://jurasic.dev/emergent_behaviour/).
