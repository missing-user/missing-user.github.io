Hi, I'm **Philipp Jurašić**, a physics student and software developer from Munich. At the moment I'm finishing my masters in Computational Science and Engineering at TUM, where I specialize in physics simulations and high performance computing. Right now I'm probably working on my master's thesis in Fusion Research with [IPP](https://www.ipp.mpg.de/en) and [Proxima Fusion](https://www.proximafusion.com/).

I love building [interactive simulations](https://jurasic.dev/2023/barnes-hut-simulation/), anything in the mountains and sometimes I use computers to [make pretty images](https://jurasic.dev/emergent_behaviour/).
